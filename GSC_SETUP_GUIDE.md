2. ✅ **Sitemap Dates**: Updated sitemap.xml with current dates instead of future dates
3. ✅ **Verification Meta Tags**: Added placeholder Google verification meta tags to all pages
4. ✅ **SEO Meta Tags**: Added additional SEO-friendly meta tags
5. ✅ **Robots.txt**: Updated to allow Google verification files and improved crawling directives
6. ✅ **Verification File**: Created placeholder HTML verification file

## Step-by-Step Google Search Console Setup

### Method 1: Meta Tag Verification (Recommended)

1. **Go to Google Search Console**
   - Visit https://search.google.com/search-console/
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Add Property**
   - Click "Add Property"
   - Choose "URL prefix" 
   - Enter: `https://1.fss.zaku79.me`
   - Click "Continue"

3. **Verify Ownership - Meta Tag Method**
   - Select "HTML tag" verification method
   - Copy the verification code from the meta tag (the content attribute value)
   - Replace `GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE` in both index.html and faq.html with your actual verification code

4. **Deploy Changes**
   - Commit and push your changes to GitHub
   - Wait for GitHub Pages to deploy (usually 5-10 minutes)

5. **Complete Verification**
   - Return to Google Search Console
   - Click "Verify"

### Method 2: HTML File Verification (Alternative)

1. **Download Verification File**
   - In Google Search Console, choose "HTML file upload" method
   - Download the verification file (e.g., `google1234567890abcdef.html`)

2. **Replace Placeholder File**
   - Delete the existing `google-site-verification.html` file
   - Upload the downloaded verification file to your repository root
   - Ensure the filename matches exactly what Google provided

3. **Deploy and Verify**
   - Commit and push to GitHub
   - Wait for deployment
   - Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

## Post-Verification Steps

Once verified successfully:

1. **Submit Sitemap**

   - Add sitemap URL: `https://1.fss.zaku79.me/sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"

2. **Monitor Coverage**
   - Check "Coverage" section for indexing status
   - Review any errors or warnings

3. **Set Up Analytics (Optional)**
